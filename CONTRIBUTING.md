# Contributing

## How to contribute

The aim of this project is to provide a simple, easy to use, and customizable boilerplate for creating a React app.
It is intended to be used as a starting point for custom React project, and to be customized to fit the needs of the project.
The idea is to support core features that modern SPA's require, but to not include any features that are not required for every project.
With this being said, it would be best to refrain from adding features that aren't in the majority of React projects.

The best way to contribute is to improve on the existing features, or to fix bugs.
If you still think that a feature should be added, please open an issue to discuss it.
